## Summary

This Python script is a targeted scan tool for CodeInventory, which uses Ollama's natural language processing engine to analyze source code and provide insights into the content.

## Description

The script imports several dependencies from the CodeInventory library, including the Scanner class for analyzing code files and the OllamaAnalyzer class for using the Ollama engine. The custom_config dictionary is used to define the configuration for the scanner and analyzer, which includes excluding certain directories, setting a maximum file size limit, and defining the extensions of supported languages. The main function initializes a Scanner object with the custom config, creates an OllamaAnalyzer object from the config, and uses the analyzer to analyze the code inventory database.

## Architectural Role

frontend

## Dependencies

- codeinventory
- pathlib
- sys
- time
- yaml

## Functions

### `main() -> None`

## Potential Issues

- potential issues with the Ollama engine's performance or accuracy
- potential issues with the Scanner class or custom configuration

## Performance Notes

The performance of the script depends on the complexity and size of the code inventory being analyzed, as well as the performance of the Ollama engine. The script can be optimized for faster analysis by reducing the number of excluded directories or increasing the maximum file size limit.
