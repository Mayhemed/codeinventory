## Summary

A RESTful API for managing a code inventory database.

## Description

The CodeInventory API provides a set of endpoints for retrieving and manipulating data in a code inventory database. It is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and leverages the sqlite3 module for handling database operations. The API also includes support for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests from different domains.
