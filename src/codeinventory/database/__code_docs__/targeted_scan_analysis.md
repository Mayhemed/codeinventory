## Summary

This python file 'targeted_scan.py' is part of CodeInventory, a software tool that helps developers analyze code quality and identify potential issues in their projects.

## Description

The file defines the main() function, which creates an instance of the Scanner class from the 'codeinventory.scanner' module. The scanner object is then used to scan the project directory for files based on a custom configuration that excludes some massive directories and includes only Python files with a maximum size of 512KB. The resulting file list is then passed to the OllamaAnalyzer class from the 'codeinventory.analyzer' module, which analyzes each file and generates a report based on the project's coding style, architecture, and other factors.

## Metrics

- **Category:** util
- **Complexity:** moderate
- **Size:** 4,813 bytes
- **Lines:** 134 total (115 code, 19 comments)

## Architectural Role

The file serves as an entry point for the CodeInventory software tool and provides the core functionality for analyzing code quality.

## Dependencies

- codeinventory
- pathlib
- sys
- time
- yaml

## Functions

### `main() -> None`

## Potential Issues

- Potentially, the custom configuration for the scanner could be too specific and may not be adaptable to different project structures

## Security Considerations

- The custom configuration for the scanner may contain sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials, which should be handled with care

## Performance Notes

The performance of this code depends on the complexity and size of the project directory being scanned. The file could benefit from optimization techniques such as lazy loading of large data structures or parallel processing.
