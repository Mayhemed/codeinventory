## Summary

The targeted_scan.py file is a Python script that performs a customized scan of a local directory using the Scanner class from the codeinventory library, and then analyzes the results using the OllamaAnalyzer class from the same library.

## Description

This script takes in a custom configuration dictionary and uses it to create an instance of the Scanner class. It then scans the specified directory for files based on the exclude list and max_file_size, and analyzes them using the OllamaAnalyzer class. The results are saved to a database.
