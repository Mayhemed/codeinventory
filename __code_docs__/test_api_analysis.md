## Summary

This Python code serves as an API for a tool inventory database using Flask and SQLite3. It provides endpoints for fetching tool data, retrieving statistics about the tool inventory, and returning a message indicating the API is running.

## Description

The code imports the Flask and sqlite3 libraries, creates a Flask app instance, defines three functions: index(), get_tools(), and get_stats(). The index() function returns a JSON object with a message indicating that the API is running. The get_tools() function fetches all tools from an SQLite3 database and returns them as a JSON array. The get_stats() function retrieves statistics about the tool inventory, including the total number of tools and language distribution. It also handles exceptions by returning a JSON object with an error message.
