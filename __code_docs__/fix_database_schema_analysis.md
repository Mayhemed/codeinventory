## Summary

Add missing columns to a SQLite database for a Python project.

## Description

The purpose of this script is to migrate an existing SQLite database to a new schema by adding missing columns and ensuring all enhanced tables exist. The script will check the existing columns in the 'tools' table and add any necessary columns, such as the 'documentation' column. Additionally, it will ensure that the 'dependencies', 'functions', and 'usage' tables exist.
